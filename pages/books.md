# Book Notes
There seems to be varying ability across the population in their ability to utilise books as a tool for learning or enjoyment. Some people can read books especially fast and retain massive amounts of information. So in this mentioned case, the amounts of books a person has read and the legitimacy of their claim to understanding is high. The trait of reading fast does not always mean that a person will have *completed* the books that they read. Nor does a person who reads fast retain lots of information. There may also be slow readers, who retain large amounts of information, and lastly, the less interesting concept of a person reading slow and understanding little. 

Some notes on books that I've read. I've these books with varying degrees of speed, information retention and enjoyment. The notes on books will be marked with some information about my interaction with the book.

#### Introduction to mineral exploration - Charles J Moon
{% code %}Incomplete{% /code %} {% code %}Focused Read{% /code %} {% code %}High Retention{% /code %}
This was one of the first books about mineral exploration that I had read. It's content is slightly dated. But because the mineral exploration industry moves in decades the contnet is still extremely relevant. Has a decent degree of technical sophistication for a beginnner to get in to. Best serves as a starting point for more advanced topics. I mainly read chapters about the economics of mineral deposits, reconnaissance, geochemical and geophysical exploration. The book contains a few case studies which are interesting, but I overlooked them. I have revisited some of the case studies in later dates. But I would approach this book with the intention of a broad overview and finding a book for each chapter to further expand and deepen your knowledge.

#### Crime and Punishment - Fyodor Dostoyevsky
{% code %}Incomplete{% /code %} {% code %}Audio Version{% /code %} {% code %}Low Retention{% /code %}
This was one of the earliest books that I had ever tried to read (I was 18 when I first read a book by my own choice). This could have also been my first audio book. I remember certain parts of the book with decent detail. Some ideas of plotline, and knowing some details of the character Raskolnikov. For whatever reason, the charachter Marmeladov is imprinted in my brain more than anything else from the book, primarily because the word [Marmeladov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment#Characters:~:text=Semyon%20Zakharovich-,Marmeladov) is slightly similar to the spanish word [Mamado](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mamado) which has various meanings across the spanish speaking world. The word Mamado can mean drunk in some countries and 'jacked'/'muscular' in spanish speaking countries. It was a funny similarity that I've used on occasion to show prowess in a book and a language that I really don't know well.

#### The Way - Jose Maria Escriva
{% code %}Complete{% /code %} {% code %}Focused Read{% /code %} {% code %}High Retention{% /code %}
For a short period in my life I was a numerary member[^1] of [Opus Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei). I read the way before I had any contact with Opus Dei, as I admired the spirit of the book. It's a collection of short sayings on specific topics in Catholic faith, such as humility, mortification, holy purity, the heart and many more. At some stages of my life I read the book most days for months on end. The book is a guiding document for Opus Dei. There are some points in the book that seem outdated even to members of Opus Dei. In general, The Way is an admirable depiction of how Jose Maria understood Jesus Christ. Where each saying is a statement, guiding the reader on how to live a life more like Jesus, while also setting the spirit of Opus Dei.

#### The remains of the day - Kazuo Ishiguro
{% code %}Complete{% /code %} {% code %}Focused Read{% /code %} {% code %}Meidium Retention{% /code %}
I can't quite put into words why I enjoyed this book so much. I have only read it once and yet it was the first book in a long time that completely captured my attention. Ishiguro's writing was extremely pleasing. Classics often tend to be translations, and the experience of reading them is often a bit frustrating. Remains of the day was the first book that I had read that was really written for the english speaker. There's a point in the book where the landscape of the english countryside is referenced as being beautiful in it;s own way for it's lack of drama. It's my intention to re-read and review this book in detail. My thinking tends to revolve around this idea of the landscape of england. It's broadly reflective of a few interesting quirks of british and to a lesser extent irish culture. The book left me with a sense of sadness, primarily from this emphasis on the lack of drama in life. I'll have to gather my thoughts on this book more in the future from a few re-reads. 

#### The commonwealth of thieves - Thomas Keneally
{% code %}Incomplete{% /code %} {% code %}Audio Version{% /code %} {% code %}High Retention{% /code %}
I began reading this book with a specific intention. I felt that there was a parrallel between the first settlers of Australia and the future settlers of Mars/Moon/Space. When you are isoloated from the rest of the world, and supplies come in monthly or yearly spurts, how would you feel? I came away with some insights in to how groups of can act when isolated from the rest of world and where resources are tight. Granted there are large differences between the colonisation of space and Australia. It was something of a reminder of the worst case scenarios that can occur. And a reminder of the adventure and danger that we can hope to expect in the coming years.

#### Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! - Richard Feynman
{% code %}Complete{% /code %} {% code %}Focused Read{% /code %} {% code %}Audio Version{% /code %} {% code %}High Retention{% /code %}
Feynman's seemed to be a man who controlled and influenced his world through story. His character shone through and he was well known for being an enjoyable and fun person to be around. But he seems to leave out intimate details of his life in his writings. I felt he belonged to a generation with a respect for narrative and it's preparation. I can't decide whether the story about ants, wobbling plates and lock combinations are examples of raw curiosity and time wasting, or thoughtful and neccesary tangents to keep a brilliant mind healthy. If I had to take a guess, I would say that Feynman understood deeply the leverage one had by being curious and creative. So it's my interpretation of Feynman that his re-telling was used to emphasises of mythologize the creative scientist.

#### Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys - Michael Collins
{% code %}Complete{% /code %} {% code %}Focused Read{% /code %} {% code %}Audio Version{% /code %} {% code %}High Retention{% /code %}
'Now’s the time, to prove through man’s action dignity may rise divinely high.' This book has special meaning to me. Collins lived a life that was incredibly normal. His description of his life in the periods prior to the moon landing are precious. For a man who went to the moon, there isnt much hubris in his writing. My take was that he was set back in life, through his creative interests and artistic pursuits. He seemed to have been the odd one out on the moon mission. But being less calculated and smooth, he stood out more. He strikes you as most deserving of his place, even though he was perhaps least merited. Glad to have read this before Collins eventually died.

#### Footnotes
[^1]: Technically speaking, I was a baby numerary member of Opus Dei. You are more technically a part time member of Opus Dei when you do your 'oblation', which I never did. So it could be said that I was never a member of Opus Dei, which would be correct. But for simplicity, I just say I was a member.
