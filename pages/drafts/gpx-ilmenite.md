## Introduction
Geophysical exploration exploits anamolous disturbances in fields to locate areas of potential mineral deposits. The methods may be active or passive. The exploration of mineral exploits knowledge of their physical properties and how we expect them to interact with their surroundings. Properties such as density, magnetic susceptibility, electrical conductivity or radioactivity might be considere when searching for some particular mineral. Ilmenite is a mineral with known density and magentic properties. It has a density of 4.72g/cm^3 and is ferromagnetic. Aerial and ground methods of studying gravitational attarction and magentic susceptibility mean that we can use these disturbances to find anomolies. These anamolies may lead to the development of a mine and finally the production of elemental titanium. Coincedentally ilmenite is found is rather large quantities on the lunar surface as documented by assays done on return samples from the apollo missions. Given recent advancements in the price of cost to launch for rockets, and manned lunar missions in the 2020’s being planned we wish to review the geophysical methods used here on earth and compare their suitability to the Lunar surface. We will examine the scientific differences in using these geophysical methods on the moon and on earth. We will also review some of the egineering challenges involved when trying to conduct geophysical exploration in non-terrestrial settings such as around or on the moon.
