# Live Now, Pay Later
Throughout the course of your day you will make many decisions. When to wake up, what to wear, how to get to work. Yet many of these decisions that we make are not fully conscious decisions. Yet the payoff from the decisions is very real. You make an unconscious decision to pull your hand off a very hot surface. This is about as fast of a feedback loop that the human brain is capable of responding to. It is unconscious yet there is a snap judgment that the payoff of that decision is very very low.

Another example that might be more clear. You’re interested in purchasing a house. Now lets say, for simplicity that there are only two houses on the market available to you. There is house A and house B. 

- House A costs $100,000, is 100 sq meters and is 1km from the city
- House B costs $300,000, is 300 sq meters and is 3km from the city

Making the decision of which house to buy is not a simple one. There is so much missing information. What does the house look like? What’s the neighbourhood like? Will I have neighbours? 

At a blind guess like this you wouldn't really have a great insight as to which ist the better house for you to live in. 

Now say that you see both the houses and realise that you like house B for the space it provides you. There are rational reasons to choose a house with larger space. Maybe you have a large family, or 300 sq meters of carpet that you inherited from your grandmother. In some other cases, where all else was equal you choose the house with more size. You may have been conscious in your consideration of the house size. But there were probably many unconscious reasons for choosing the house because of size. 

Now you get  a mortgage, purchase the house, pay the taxes due, move in your carpets etc. After moving in you settle in to the house and realise there is a long commute along a busy road when you’re driving to work. You are past the point of it making sense to sell the house, and buy a house closer to the city. 

What happened here is that you did not realise the full experience of your decision at the moment it was made. In fact you probably never can. As time goes on, you get closer to realising the full experience of living there. You realise there is a neighbour who plays the drums, that a military jet flies overhead every Thursday, that the ice cream truck that comes by in the winter is most probably selling drugs. 

What happened here was that there was an absence of feedback for an unconscious decision. You did not get any feedback immediately in making the decision to purchase the house. Would you have been better off in purchasing the cheaper, smaller but more proximate house? Again you don’t know. In any case you’re stuck. After making a decision, the ability to reverse becomes more difficult. 

But there is something we can do to limit our exposure to poor decisions. We increase the rate of received feedback. It’s important here to not only increase the feedback rate for some but many consequences of our decisions. This short exposure may be more painful at first. In fact we take much more risk more often. However the risks should be limited in duration and importantly reversible.

**Applications to the housing market**

The proposal here is a purchasing system where you live and rent in the house for some limited period of time, before being allowed to purchase the house. You can move in, you can experience the house, and get an actual sense of what it means for you to make this decisions. 

This system could be summarised as a ‘buy later, live now’ system. 

The buyer gets a much better understanding of the house. They experience real feedback. They live in the house and get to know it’s nuances. They know that the ceiling is actually a bit to0 low for them, or that the neighbours cigar smoke blows in their window in the evening. They live for a month in the house. Not completely free of unconscious bias, but now better informed. 

The seller of the house does not explicitly gain much from this. However implicitly they do. The buy later, live now system is universal. So when they want to sell a house, they must make sure that the house is liveable. The chances for obfuscation are less. They can’t put up a good show. Dressing the house to seem much nicer than it really is. So they must pay more careful attention to the house. They address the issues that they know, after living in the house, annoyed them and others. They fix the crooked doors, ask the neighbour to stop smoking, pay closer attention to the surrounding neighbourhood. 

When the seller goes to buy a house, then the same standard will hopefully apply. They live in a new house for some period of time, and that owner, hopefully put the same care and consideration in to the house.
