# Site philosophy 

## What the site is not
I showed a friend this site in it's infancy to get a sense of their perception. The first question they had was what it's all for. The conversation started around university grads and personal websites. My site had no obvious portfolio work, besides the site itself. I thought it was easier to define what the site was not, to clarify my own thinking on what it was. It is not a technical portfolio site. Although it has and will continue to have content around technology. It is not a tool to get a job. Although I may find work through incoming interactions from the site. I may have to make further definitions of what this site is not in the future.

## Early influences
But why did I start a site in the first place? If you go back far enough you will find different websites attached to this domain. You will find that this site, was a tool for finding jobs and showing technical work. But I have kept the domain and updated the site over time. At some point the site came closer to its current form. I turned away from technology and the internet in my teens. I rediscovered a passion for lots of things in my early 20's that led to this site. So after several years of avoiding technology, I made my Augustinian conversion.


I started traversing around the internet looking for things to read on startups. I found [Paul Grahams](http://www.paulgraham.com/) and [Sam Altman's](https://blog.samaltman.com/) blogs at first. I did a lot of bouncing from that point. Something like the Paul Graham -> [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) -> [Alex Guzey](https://guzey.com/) -> [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/) -> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/) pipeline. The path was more varied than that. But it should show that some of why I started a site was by reading these other sites. At some point the dominant influences went from cliche and cringe to unique and less cringe. Reading some of Aaron Swartz impressed an early internet culture on me. Which makes up some of the philosophy of this site. 
## Aaron swartz and early internet culture
In the early internet culture, the idea of a URI or URL had an idea of continuity embedded in to it. A URL to many was a permanent part of the internet. Thought should go in to the classification of a page. The URL's themselves should be permanent, or if they are removed, that they redirect. To me, this appeared as a type of continuity of the memory of the internet. That we could trace back the routes of what was or wasn't said about someone or some thing. The idea of sites and URL's having continuity was something I paired with some other disparate thoughts to make up a philosophy of this site.

## Catholicism and the continuity of ideas and thought
The concept of continuity is important within Catholicism. Jesus has his lineage traced back to Abraham and Adam. The New testament is the fulfillment of the old. The Pope traces his lineage back to Saint Peter. This concept of continuity is deeply embedded in to the Catholic intellectual and spiritual culture. The Church is often spoken as a 'living organism', likened to a tree with many branches, all with one single root. Interpretation is done through the context of continuity. The Church itself is always changing, but it moves rooted to fundamentals. 

## Rigidity and dogmatism
The Church calls for members to make a supra rational decision of faith on dogma. When applied to a metaphysical system this is not unreasonable. But in doing so, you bind yourself to dogma. The inerrant nature of dogma is of course a [hard teaching](https://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm). Leaving that system aside, we often bring it to other areas of our lives or have it embedded in non metaphysical systems. Leaving that dogmatism behind, while holding fast to the truth leaves you in a different, but not wholly different system. Which is analogous I believe to my own system of thinking, and by extension this site. There are of course deeper thoughts to be had about the nature of truth, fallibility and the tools we have to know truth. And they should be expansions in this sites philosophy, if some deeper insight comes about.

## Influences and the role in the philosophy of language
The influences section of this site follows from the Catholic understanding of continuity. Giving people in the future an ability to understand your thinking as it may have occurred to you. This brings about another contribution to the idea of continuity in this site. In much of the modern analytical tradition of philosophy, there is a strong emphasis on clarity and precision of speech and writing. Agreement on the terms we use may be possible. But agreement on the context, and our 'experience' of the word and the world may not be possible. But we can come closer. If we understand the words of a conversation, AND we understand the shared context of speakers are we not better informed. It's my belief that influences and experiential factors may lead us closer to the truth. Especially when considering the proper understanding of what someone said in the past. With this being the case, I've attached influences to this site. The influences could be anything. A summer holiday when you were 10, to a girlfriend you had when you were 40. Books you've read, experiences you've had. If I can know your influences, and you make some attempt at uncovering truth, then maybe by these influences I can know truth better too.

## Truth
Finally, the larger purpose of this site is to try and do my part in seeking Truth. I am naturally inclined towards science and technology and so a lot of the endeavoring might be in that direction. But altogether the purpose should be uniform. I don't believe there is anything more worthwhile than pursuing truth. However I can't immediately outline why there is no higher reason in the context of this piece of writing. However I may add a piece in the future and link to it here. 

Enjoy.
