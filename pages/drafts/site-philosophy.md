# Site philosophy 

## Early influences

But why did I start a site in the first place? If you go back far enough you will find different websites attached to this domain. You will find that this site, was a tool for finding jobs and showing technical work. But I have kept the domain and updated the site over time. At some point the site came closer to its current form. I turned away from technology and the internet in my teens. I rediscovered a passion for lots of things in my early 20's that led to this site. So after several years of avoiding technology, I made my Augustinian conversion.

I started traversing around the internet looking for things to read on startups. I found [Paul Grahams](http://www.paulgraham.com/) and [Sam Altman's](https://blog.samaltman.com/) blogs at first. I did a lot of bouncing from that point. Something like the Paul Graham -> [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) -> [Alex Guzey](https://guzey.com/) -> [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/) -> [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/) pipeline. The path was more varied than that. But it should show that some of why I started a site was by reading these other sites. At some point the dominant influences went from cliche and cringe to unique and less cringe. Reading some of Aaron Swartz impressed an early internet culture on me. Which makes up some of the philosophy of this site.

## Aaron swartz and early internet culture

In the early internet culture, the idea of a URI or URL had an idea of continuity embedded in to it. A URL to many was a permanent part of the internet. Thought should go in to the classification of a page. The URL's themselves should be permanent, or if they are removed, that they redirect. To me, this appeared as a type of continuity of the memory of the internet. That we could trace back the routes of what was or wasn't said about someone or some thing. The idea of sites and URL's having continuity was something I paired with some other disparate thoughts to make up a philosophy of this site.

## Catholicism and the continuity of ideas and thought

The concept of continuity is important within Catholicism. Jesus has his lineage traced back to Abraham and Adam. The New testament is the fulfillment of the old. The Pope traces his lineage back to Saint Peter. This concept of continuity is deeply embedded in to the Catholic intellectual and spiritual culture. The Church is often spoken as a 'living organism', likened to a tree with many branches, all with one single root. Interpretation is done through the context of continuity. The Church itself is always changing, but it moves rooted to fundamentals. From this I hope to get across the point of continuity. This is not meant to be continuity in the rigid sense. It is more continuity in an aesthetic sense. Something that would appeal to a historian more than anything. I have always been quite influenced by my wider families obsession with lineage. For someone who comes from peasant farmers, I can go back several generations in my family. 

The continuity and the interest of lineage means that I wish continuity to be shown as part of lineage. I would like to see myself and show to others the continuity of my own thoughts. Will this be interesting to most people? no. But because I am interested in the lives of my great grand parents i assume that there may be a chance that one of mine will be likewise interested. To see the way a person thought at some point in time, to understand there influences. That to me is interesting. It is the historical inclination that I have. 

## Rigidity and dogmatism

The Church calls for members to make a supra rational decision of faith on dogma. When applied to a metaphysical system this is not unreasonable. But in doing so, you bind yourself to dogma. The inerrant nature of dogma is of course a [hard teaching](https://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm). Leaving that system aside, we often bring it to other areas of our lives or have it embedded in non metaphysical systems. Leaving that dogmatism behind, while holding fast to the truth leaves you in a different, but not wholly different system. Which is analogous I believe to my own system of thinking, and by extension this site. There are of course deeper thoughts to be had about the nature of truth, knowledge, and the tools we have to know such things if they exist. And they should be expansions in this sites philosophy, if some deeper insight comes about.

The implication of this is that I am very willing to change my thinking on many things, have in the past and hopefully will again in the future. To me dogmatism is an incorrecta approach to thinking and acting about matters of the world which conflict us. There is something appealing to me about being in a state of constant fear and trembling. About God of course, but about our own reasoning and our faith in some system of thinking. Abraham I don’t see as being massively different to socrates in this example. But this is an aesthetic take.

## Influences and the role in the philosophy of language

The influences section of this site follows from the Catholic understanding of continuity. Giving people in the future an ability to understand your thinking as it may have occurred to you. This brings about another contribution to the idea of continuity in this site. In much of the modern analytical tradition of philosophy, there is a strong emphasis on clarity and precision of speech and writing. Agreement on the terms we use may be possible. But agreement on the context, and our 'experience' of the word and the world may not be possible. But we can come closer. If we understand the words of a conversation, AND we understand the shared context of speakers are we not better informed. It's my belief that influences and experiential factors may lead us closer to the truth. Especially when considering the proper understanding of what someone said in the past. With this being the case, I've attached influences to this site. The influences could be anything. A summer holiday when you were 10, to a girlfriend you had when you were 40. Books you've read, experiences you've had. If I can know your influences, and you make some attempt at uncovering truth, then maybe by these influences I can know truth better too.

A person reading my site, my get a sense of the poeple I’ve read, the ways that I think about things and all of this can lead them to understand in a recursive manner. You get sense of the meaning by the meaning itself. You see that I am likely to get picked up by fits of excitement at any time and so you can maybe understand that fit in that lens. But you understand not just the fit, but the things before and after the fit. 

## Truth or whatever is out there

I generally hold the beliefe that there is something we refer to as truth. What that is I am unsure. Yet I havent thought about that in a serious manner. It is an act of faith in a sense. A faith in truth. Of course I intend to spend time and intellect on that problem. To help myself uncover something there. But I’m very uncertain and comfortable in being so. 

I believe this something I am more naturally inclined to be. I am very comfortabile with ambiguety or a sense of arbitrariness. I am comfortable being unsure and uncertain in my daily life. When the bus comes, what my next job will be, what I will amount to. I think this contributes to me viewing truth in this less sure way. 

## Book notes

Book notes serve multiple functions. They are a signal. Which means that books in general, ideas and the content of the ideas are a method to attract those who are interested in similar things. Access to more people like this means access to more potential friends, and more friends who I enjoy being around makes me happy.

As such there is a page with books that has the following system. 

- There is a list of books that I've read.
- Each book has one or more idea tags associated with it.
- Some books link to a page with more in depth notes on the book.
- Some of the linked ideas have a page with more in depth notes on the idea.
- There is a list of all the idea tags of the books.

## Modern index cards

The idea for this site came from the book how to write a thesis by Umberto Eco. A lot of the stuff there is outdated, some of it is too formalistic, but the idea of it was very interesting. I thought I would begin to convert this system to an interent native system. There is no need to use the physical note cards. Yet tehy also have these lovely phsycial connection properties that are perfect for the internet. You can reference thinsg easily in your research. You can consult your notes on something in the blink of an eye. If you like, you can start to draw all kinds of graphs on the things you know. This system is so much capable for the researcher or the learner. 

## An open door

Richard Hamming wrote in his art of science and engineering that the people who kept an open door to their offcie were the ones that would do the best. They benefited from interacting with people more often and the chances for serendipidy were greater. In the context of an open sytem of notes, the whole world can see what you are working on. The hoe would be that when you expose your work to others in this way, that it dramatically amplifies the serendipdity of interactions. One person gets in contact with you because they read something on your site that is similar to something that they too are working on. The thing was something you perhaps abondoned and now can pick up with much greater insight for example. This site is an open door. Or more that it is an open door where I’m sitting in my office with airpods on. You can come and see what I’m working on, read my stuff, but there’s a minor communication stop between us. Perhaps this is better. You get the benefits of focus with the upsides of openness.

## Ideas

When something pops in to my mind, or when I amtrying to research in some area then I may add something to an idea note. This is not a definitive piece of writing. It’s something quick. If I think it’s useful or insightful it may get referenced elsewhere. Think of the notes as like those in a book. They can be reused later when contructing some more thorough argument. They should be a bit more loose. This allows greater creativity. You want to avoid in my opinion the negatives of exxcesive censure when you are writing somethin more serious. You have the risk that you censure yourself a little since it’s public notes. However you can always fall back that this was non serious and something you’re willing to correct on. It might also limit the posisbility that you err on a whole system. You instead deal with things on a divided basis. If one idea is faulty it doesnt mean that they all are. 

## Selected readings

Nassim Taleb once spoke about social media as always existing. That it was the mid 20th century that was an abberation. We always picked up and gave out information. So in that way social media is lindy. I like this idea. So in this spirit the selected readings are thing that I’ve picked up on that have been interesting. Something analagous to a selected links, ‘best of’ type list. Adding to this is some of the ideas of historical  interest so you can see the things I was reading or that I was interested in some week.
