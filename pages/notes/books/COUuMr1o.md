# The Open Society and Its Enemies
## Heraclitus
 
Popper puts [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus) as one of the first historicist thinkers
 
That he put forward the idea of constant flux or change as the unifying rule of history and the nature
 
It is different from things like [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer), where the gods are the writers of history, but there is a disharmony , and they are all writing different parts of the story and going against each other.
 
The idea of the ‘chosen people’ is first introduced here. Like in the jewish literature for example.
 
Heraclitus was a member of the aristocracy in [Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus), and when the revolutions in Greece started to occur in favour of democracy, they scorned the idea
 
{% quote %}‘Everything is in flux and nothing is at rest’ is the motto of his philosophy{% /quote %}
 
Popper puts forward the idea  that in these ancient greek times, the idea that everyone knows their place is quite common
 
{% quote %}[Heraclitus says]’The mob does not care, even about the things they stumble upon; Nor can they grasp a lesson-though they think they do’{% /quote %}
 
Popper believes this is where the idea about a ‘law of destiny’ comes about
 
Popper believes it is common that in times of great social change that historicism will come about.
 
{% quote %}It often seems as if they were trying to comfort themselves for the loss of a stable world by clinging to the idea that change is ruled by an unchanging law{% /quote %}
 
{% quote %}Every process in the world, and especially fire itself, develops according to a definite law, its ‘measure’. It is an inexorable and irresistible law, and to this extent it resembles our modern conception of natural law as well as the conception of historical or evolutionary laws of modern historicists{% /quote %}
 
 
{% quote %}This failure to distinguish between legal laws or norms on the one hand and the natural laws or regularities on the other is characteristic of tribal taboos{% /quote %}
 
 
Popper also believes that wrapped up with a lot of the ideas of destiny is the idea of mysticism. Where there is this sort of hidden nature to the way things are changing. A sort of anti rationalism.
 
Heraclitus criticises scientists of his day like Pythagoras
 
Heraclitus has this idea that there is a special characteristic of intuition that is the special property of ‘the chosen people’ and that this contrasts a lot with the scientific view.
 
The winners of war are also amongst the chosen people to Heraclitus
 
{% quote %}For he holds he holds that the outcome of war is always just{% /quote %}
 
 
Popper puts the question to Heraclitus' work that if everything is always changing, then the standard of merit must also be changing. Which he believes that Heraclitus answers this in his doctrine of the identity of the opposites
 
The law of change is one neatly wrapped up in the law of opposites. Where hot things move to cold. Rich goes to poor. A path leading east is also a path leading west.
 
This Popper puts forward as a relativism of values that Heraclitus puts forward
 
{% quote %}It seems as if historicist ideas easily become prominent in times of great social change{% /quote %}
 
{% quote %}It appears to be more than a mere coincidence that [Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel), who adopted so much of Heraclitus’ thought and passed it on to all modern historicist movements, was a mouthpiece of the reaction against the French Revolution{% /quote %}

{% quote %}*The learning of any things teacheth not understanding, else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hekataios*{% /quote %} - Fragments of heraclitus - John Burnett using Bywater 1877 for numbering

 
 
Heraclitus pushes the idea that you may know lots of things but not understand them. But it isn't the way that feynman spoke about understanding, where what you are doing is remembering the names of things. [Pythogoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) put forward lots of original new things, but because there was no ‘learning’ as defined in the way Heraclitus puts it, then it’s not real.
 
## Plato’s Theory of Forms or ideas
 
The idea here is to look at [Plato’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) political philosophy to show how it is essentially historicist and to set up its criticism in later chapters.
 
Popper makes the same point about Plato as he does about Heraclitus. That he grew up in a time of great strife and that he seemed to make much of the same inclinations toward a divine law that governed the universe as a way to deal with a complex and changing world.
 
It picks up a common thread here on the denigration of society.
 
{% quote %}All social change is corruption or decay or degeneration{% /quote %}
 
Plato takes the idea however that you can overcome this degeneration by the will and through knowledge of the forms.
 
Popper outlines a common link in some of the historicist thinking which is naturalist imprints on their philosophy.
 
Not unlike the Biblical story, there is a primogenitor, a first thing which is perfect and all things after it a copy of not absolute correctness.
 
There is also talk about some Cyclic laws, corresponding more or less to the seasons of growth and decay.
 
Popper believed that Plato looked at his age as one of deep depravity
 
{% quote %}so the advent of of the cosmic turning point would manifest itself in the coming of a great law-giver whose powers of reasoning and whose moral will are capable of bringing this period of political decay to a close{% /quote %}
 
This idea of a law giver is in many ways messianic. There are some parallels with St.Paul and the law here.
 
There is some attempt in the philosophy of Plato to return again to some stage of perfection before the degeneration. This is not unlike the return to heaven or to a state of being that was once perfect like in the garden of eden.
 
This is where Popper proposes that social engineering is the approach that is opposed to historicism
 
Social engineering treats the method as the tool, in the way we define it.
 
Here society is treated more as an organism, a living thing that is always changing.
 
Separates the difference between piecemeal and utopian social engineering.
 
The social engineering approach looks at our aims and then asks questions about whether institutions are helping us achieve these aims
 
{% quote %}We can say that the engineer or the technology approaches institutions rationally as means that serve certain ends, and that as a technologist he judges them wholly according to their appropriateness, efficiency and simplicity.{% /quote %}
 
But that institutions are not instruments, but that they can be looked at as an instrument.
 
To Plato the forms are not mere ideas. But more real than all other things.
 
There are some good explanations of the idea of the forms and their origins. Again you see this naturalist idea pop up where there is a father, mother and child conception of forms. Where the father is the forms, the mother is space and time, and the child is the degeneration of the forms into something that is substantial.
 
To plato all things are degenerations of the original form.
 
There’s yet another interesting comparison to be made between the participation of things with their form or essence. This idea is that any idea is derived from its original form, and that it shares in its form. It participates in its whiteness, coldness, and bedness. It’s not dissimilar to the idea of divination in Christianity. Where the return to some original state is looked at as this participation in the nature of God. ‘Sharing in the nature of God like a poker in the flame’
 
{% quote %}They participate in the sense in which children participate in their fathers possessions and gifts{% /quote %}
 
 
{% quote %}What he[Plato] was looking for was knowledge, not opinion. {% /quote %}
 
 
Plato is struck by the difficulty of discussing politics when the words and their meaning always change over time. If you can't agree on government or democracy then what can you do with that?
 
Plato traces much of his thinking on the derivation of the forms from the substance of real things to Socrates. by enquiring about the nature of the world, we can come to know the forms. This is a backtracking from the sensible to the unsensible forms
 
Popper believes that the same type of thing has been done in certain other thinkers such as JS Mill in ‘On liberty’
 
Popper defines the two terms here that he thinks describes the two different systems of thinking. these are
 
- Methodological essentialism
 
- Methodological nominalism
 
The essentialist is looking for the true essence of things. They’re looking for some hidden nature of the word.
 
Things have definitions and the definitions have names and they can be described by words.
 
Plato uses this thinking for such things as proofs of the soul.
 
The contrast is methodological nominalism. This aims at describing how something behaves or works. Looking at whether there are regularities in its behaviour.
 
{% quote %}The methodological nominalism will never think a question like ‘what is energy’ or ‘what is movement’ or ‘what is an atom’ is an important question for physics but he will attach importance to a question like ‘how can the energy of the Sun be made useful’ or ‘how does a planet move’ or ‘under what condition does an atom radiate light’{% /quote %}
 
{% quote %}And to the philosophers who tell him that before having answered ‘what is’ question he cannot hope to give exact answers to any of the how questions he will reply if it all by pointing out that he much prefers that modest degree of exactness which he can achieve by his methods to the pretentious muddle which they have achieved by theirs{% /quote %}
 
 
Popper contends that there are many  who have answered this question of the essence of the thing. They believe the difference in method is necessary. Some of these thinkers are
 
- JS Mill (On Logic)
- Karl Marx
- M. Weber
- G. Simmel
- Vierkandt
- MacIver
- See also Husserl's Phenomenology

# Change and Rest
 
Popper introduces Plato's theory of society as he sees it.
 
Plato's theory of change and rest, particularly political revolution, builds a mode that explains the theory of society in Greece.
 
Because of the ideas behind the forms, Plato views things that move away from the forms as evil and closer to the forms as good.
 
This is more generally moved to be understood as change being evil, unless it is a change towards the good. And Stasis being good, unless it is stasis in evil.
 
Things that are unchanging share in the very nature of the forms, and are in communion with the good.
 
Platos uses this lens to explain certain types of denigrations in society. Men degenerate in to women because of a lack of virtue (lacking courage)
 
Lacking in wisdom, you degenerate into the beasts.
 
The idea of the forms and the idea of degeneration was, in Aristotle's view, a method in which you could have pure or rational knowledge in a world that is always changing.
 
This idea of degeneration follows a similar question about that true, Form, of the state.
 
He observed certain older states, like that in Sparta and in Crete as being closer in form to the true Form of the state, as opposed to the democracies in Athens.
 
Platos goes back even further from Sparta and Crete, noting some of their deficiencies, and asks what came before them.
 
The further back you go, the closer you get to the original best state. Which Platos sees as probably being some Nomadic state, led by a single ‘Shepherd’ who leads the sheep.
 
He creates a theory of rank or order in the various types of states, by applying this theory of change and degeneration to the various types of government.
 
Noble Kingship > Timarchy/Timocracy > Oligarchy > Democracy > Tyranny
 
{% quote %}According to Plato, internal strife, class war, fomented by self-interest and especially material or economic self -interest, is the main force of social dynamics.{% /quote %}
 
 
{% quote %} We see that Plato aimed at setting out a system of historical periods, governed by a law of evolution; In other words, he aimed at a historicist theory of society. This attempt was revived by Rousseau, and was made fashionable by Comte and Mill, and by Hegel and Marx; but considering the historical evidence then available, Plato’s system of of historical periods was as good as that of any of these modern historicists.{% /quote %}
 
Plato believed that the first class struggle occurs between virtue and money.
 
Plato looks at democracy with almost complete contempt according to Popper.
 
Much of these attitudes is seen in treatment of slaves in the states of Athens and Sparta according to Plato. Slaves are treated almost as if they were free. And Popper believes that Athens probably came the closest to being the first state to abolish it.
 
Popper believes that the 6 types of government that are introduced by Plato are unimportant, because Plato himself stated that the states can occur in degrees and is not a rigid description.
 
The Main distinction is that states can be ruled by one, a few, or the many.
 
Plato puts forward muc of the idea of a City of God. That is ruled by a philosopher King
 
Plato's best state emphasises class distinctions dramatically. It is almost a near caste system.
 
The books where much of this is discussed are in the
 
- Republic
- Timaeus
- Critias
 
According to Popper, the castes in Plato's society are essentially just the military caste, of which belong the warriors and the educated, and the working classes.
 
Because of many of the ideas about degeneration and the forms, the state ruled by this leading class mustn't ever degenerate down to the level of the working classes. Even the idea of legislating for the lower classes is almost forbidden, like the state of the proles in 1984.
 
The attitude towards slaves is made worse in many of these pieces on poltical philosophy. Where enslavement of barbarians is encouraged.
 
{% quote %}Do unto bar barbarians as greeks no do unto greeks {% /quote %}
 
The idea of family is also criticised. Because family loyalties are seen to be something that brings about disunion, and so the nobel should view themselves as a singular ‘family’
 
In fact Popper believes that much of the attitude towards the lower classes by the ruling, is to bring about contempt for them. Because if they despise the ruling class, they will stop from disuniting themselves.
 
Of which ideas of mingling among the classes are not to be had. Because a mingling of the classes might bring about attitudes of sympathy, and thus disunion within the ruling classes, if one person despises who the other person does not.
 
 
{% quote %}Regarding the origin of the ruling class, it may be mentioned that Plato speaks in the Statesman of a time, prior even to that of the best state, where ‘God himself was the shepherd of men, ruling over them exactly as man… still rules over the beasts’{% /quote %}
 
Popper doesn't believe that this is the simile/parable of the good Shepherd. but that it’s a direct claim about the way in which the original government came about
 
To Popper, Plato thought a man and education should be fierce, but not too fierce. So the ideas of education are in gymnastics and music. Too much of one of the other is not good. That you should be both gentle and fierce.
 
There are additional ideas on the general militarization of the young, where they should always be constantly shown violence and fierceness unless they get too soft.
 
Again, Plato stresses disunion of the ruling class over economic affairs being the cause for political strife
 
Popper makes a direct criticism of O.Spenglers ‘ The decline of the west'' as being centrally historicist.
 
# Nature and convention
 
The idea of separation between natural laws and normative laws
 
The natural law is some fact about the natural world or the universe
 
A normative law is some custom or tradition that we follow for some reason.
 
It’s the distinction between the two that Popper wishes for us to get correct.
 
Popper goes on to show that in history there has been a development towards this distinction.
 
He describes the starting point as ***naive monism***
 
Where there is no distinction between these natural and normative laws, there is naive monism. that is a ‘oneness’ of the laws of nature and society.
 
Popper brings about some more ideas out of this. Namely that there are two different ways of looking at the laws that emphasise either the natural or the conventions.
 
naive naturalism emphasises that there is a natural law of society and that the natural laws of society are things which adhere to the laws of nature. That is things that occur in nature without the distortion of civilization.
 
Naive naturalism might be best described as might is right type laws
 
Naive conventionalism can also be employed in the same manner.
 
This  Naive conventionalism is that the natural laws are the things that have existed. It’s because of this definition a form of conservatism. Where the only right thing is what has existed.
 
The next evolutionary step to popper here is the idea of critical dualism. Here the idea of natural laws is held and normative laws are also held. But the natural laws are much more strict in this sense.
 
Critical dualism says that normative  laws can be changed by man, because it has recognised them as such.
 
You agree with the norms or conventions asserted by man in the first place. But that it was a man made  assertion and not something that we discovered to be the case.
 
Popper introduces, what is essentially a logical difference between facts and the statements of facts which are in this case the same types of things as the normative  and natural laws
 
He uses the following example
 
FACT: Napoleon died on St.Helena
 
Person A: Napoleon died on St.Helena
 
Person B: Person B said that Napoleon died on St.Helena
 
What popper goes on to show here is that you can't actually know the fact of something from the definition.
 
That one person said something may be considered a fact. But we can infer from what a person said the original fact.
 
You can reformulate this as something like The body of someone that fits the description of Napoleon was found on st.helena. But unless you’re dealing with the actual thing here, then you can’t go much further than the definitions.
 
{% quote %}That most people agree with the norm ‘*Thou shalt not steal’* is a fact. But that ‘*Thou shalt not steal’* is not a fact, and can never be inferred from sentences describing facts{% /quote %}
 
The claim that will probably start to come about is that there is no thing that is morally right. Which is not the case. Popper goes on to claim that this does not rule out that there are rules which are ‘Natural laws’ but that by definitions we can’t infer them.
 
It doesn't rule out the idea of religion either. For you could hold that in order to get a proper sense of what some natural law is, you need to allow religion to be some guide to you.
 
The insistence that you alone make the decision about what is right or wrong, is not to mean that you cannot be helped by faith in the process.
 
He sets out that this is the view of Socrates imploring Zeus.
 
{% quote %}The doctrine of the autonomy of ethics is independent of the problem of religion, but compatible with, or perhaps even necessary for any religion which respects individual conscience{% /quote %}
The idea of the definitions of things applies to religion here too. You may accept that your definition of God is a fact. And that that definition implies other things that you ought to follow. For example your definition of God might lead to some conclusion that he is all loving and that a person following this ethic should believe that they ought to be loving too.
 
Care has to be taken, in Popper's eyes, to know that the institutions we live in are woven with normative and natural(sociological) laws.
 
To popper, although institutions can be looked upon as if they were machines, this does not mean that they are machines.
 
The types of things that are used in the place of these natural laws are
 
- Biological naturalism
- Ethical or juridical positivism
- psychological or spiritual naturalism
 
The ways that these natural laws come about, in the way outlined above can mistake the person considering them.
 
This naive monism can be used to prove both humanitarian and totalitarian principles alike
 
Biological naturalism might assert that norms themselves are contrary to nature
 
That there is natural inequality to men can be used to infer rigid class distinction or that we ought to have humanitarian compensation for it.
 
Popper is of the belief that it is spiritual naturalism that can be used in the most diverse range of situations. That it can be used to infer that the wise and just should rule or that all people should be treated as equals.
