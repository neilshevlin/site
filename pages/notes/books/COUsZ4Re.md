# A commonwealth of thieves - Thomas Keneally
I began reading this book with a specific intention. I felt that there was a parrallel between the first settlers of Australia and the future settlers of Mars/Moon/Space. When you are isoloated from the rest of the world, and supplies come in monthly or yearly spurts, how would you feel? I came away with some insights in to how groups of can act when isolated from the rest of world and where resources are tight. Granted there are large differences between the colonisation of space and Australia. It was something of a reminder of the worst case scenarios that can occur. And a reminder of the adventure and danger that we can hope to expect in the coming years.
