# Introduction to mineral exploration - Charles J Moon
This was one of the first books about mineral exploration that I had read. It's content is slightly dated. But because the mineral exploration industry moves in decades the contnet is still extremely relevant. Has a decent degree of technical sophistication for a beginnner to get in to. Best serves as a starting point for more advanced topics. I mainly read chapters about the economics of mineral deposits, reconnaissance, geochemical and geophysical exploration. The book contains a few case studies which are interesting, but I overlooked them. I have revisited some of the case studies in later dates. But I would approach this book with the intention of a broad overview and finding a book for each chapter to further expand and deepen your knowledge.
