# Kant - A very shory introduction - Roger Scruton

- Kant was interested in solving all of metaphysics' puzzle, with a focus on the controversy between the Rationalists and Empiricists.
- The controversy was centered on the question of objective knowledge - could one know the world without experiencing it?
- Rationalists believed that reason was the only tool for understanding the world, while Empiricists argued that experience was key.
- Kant found that both were necessary - experience without reason was just meaningless, raw sensation.
- Kantian philosophy is based on the belief that the world is understood through the perspective of a rational creature 
- This creature imposes "categories" of thought onto the world in order to understand it 
- The categories are not descriptive of the world as it really is, but they are universal in the sense that they can represent any object that can be experienced 
- As a result, there is a division between the world as it appears and the world as it really is 
- It is central to Kantian philosophy that the world as it really is completely unreachable for humanity
- Kant was skeptical about the soul, but deduced that it had the faculty of understanding
- Practical judgment is the faculty by which a person decides what to do, and is the source of an ethical life
- If humans are to have an ethical life, they must first have free will
- Kant established that humans have free will by distinguishing between the phenomenal and noumenal
- Ethical living is living in accordance with pure practical reason
- The categorical imperative is the fundamental principle of Kant's ethical theory
- Kant's metaphysics and ethics are the most well-known aspects of his work
- He used transcendental philosophy to understand the seemingly paradoxical nature of beauty
- Kant was a classical liberal in tune with the spirit of the Enlightenment
- He opposed democracy but also distrusted monarchy
- He was an advocate of an ill-defined republicanism

## Notes
- Scruton has written several book on philosophy, including some other ones where he summarizes philsophies in a short treatment such as this.
- Even summaries of Kant's work are dense. You need to take your time reading them. I made the mistake of trying to listen to this. 
- Kant is where so much of traditional philosophy places their arc, as to where philsophy really started to change in the dramatic fashion that it did. 
- A revisit of kant, or this summary, might be good after some experience with more modern analytical philosophy.
- I've to read more about Kantian notions of free will, the noumenal and the phenomenal in light of AI and philosophy of the mind.
