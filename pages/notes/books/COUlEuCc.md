# How to write a thesis - Umberto Eco

## Essay writing framework

This is a writing framework adapted from Umberto Eco’s ‘How to write a thesis’. 

**Choosing a topic**

- Reflect your previous studies and experience.
- Sources shoud be accessible
- Sources should be manageble
- Be experienced with the methodological framework. (Know what you need to know)

Further choosing a topic

1. Choose a topic that is not too broad. 
2. Decide if it will be historical or theoretical
3. Ideally understand some of the foreighn language when writing on a topic of foreign language

The pre-requisites of a scientific essay

1. Research deals with a specific object that others can identify. 
2. Say something that has not been said about an object or revise previously said things in a new light
3. Allow it to be useful to others
4. Provide the elements that are needed to verify or disprove the hypothesis(falsifiability)

**Sources**

Eco stresses the importance of both the comprehensiveness of sources and the directness of the sources. Where possible try to get access to all the primary sources of the subject at hand. If you are studying a partcular authorm you need to be able to get access to the original documents. If you cannot find that, the consider doing an analysis of the critical sources and their interpretation. 

Translations are not direct sources. → Why you should know the language. 

Anthologies are not direct sources. → Perhaps useful for a first pass of the documents but not for a direct source. 

Good photocopies of the original can be considered direct sources. 

An edition by a historiographer can be considered direct if the historiographer in question is of very high rigour and has not been challenged on his documents before. 

Never quote from a quote. 

Never quote from an indirect source pretending to have read the original. 

 

**Quoting sources**

Eco tries to get across the importance of precision when quoting docuements. There are a few incorrect ways to reference an author of a book. Generally try to get these things right 

1. Author name is clearly distuingishable (First Name, Last Name)
2. Book title is NOT in quotation marks
3. Journals and chapters ARE in quotation marks
4. The publisher can be easily distuingished NOT JUST the location
5. Include the date of the first edition publishing or later dates. 

The given examples are used in the translated version of Eco’s book. 

**Quoting Books**

> Searle, John R. *Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language.* 5th ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974. First published 1969.
> 

or

> Wilson, John. *Philosophy and Religion: The Logic of Religious Belief*. London: Oxford University Press, 1961.
> 

**Quoting Journals**

> Anceschi, Luciano. “Orizzonte della poesia” (Horizon of poetry). Il Veri, n.s., 1 (February 1962):6-21.
> 

Article is in quotation marks. Journal in Italics. Allows us to understand that the article is a short text and not a book. n.s. means that the journal is a new series

For further guides on the following consult section 3.2 in the english transaltion of Eco’s book

**Beginning**

Eco stresses that the revision of the written piece will be neccesary. But that starting off with a scaffold would be the best way to operate. This is because he believes it is better to adjust a framework than to adjust no framework. The way that he suggests that you do this is the following. 

1. Title and subtitle. 
2. Table of contents
3. Introduction

The title and subtitle are there to steer you in the general direction of an object. But you can of course adjust this as you go. 

The table of contents is an excericise of clearly writing out your ideas, even in the most abstract sense. It give you a structure of what you will likley write about. It is aroute that you think you will take. But there is no problem in changing the route and doing something different. But you update the table of contents as you go. 

The Introduction then is almost a summary of the what you think will be the completed work. It should allow the reader to get a quick and brief synopsis of your work and then be satisfied with it from there. At the outset, it is fine to be ambitous and ‘go to far’ As you will revise the introduction as you go on. 

**Bibliography**

Eco suggests in his book that your bibliographybe prepared but not static during the course of writing. You want to be able to get a full set of all the important texts for your topic. But at the beginning you may neglect to add some important topics. 

He makes a suggestion that on the outset you read just one book. And through the citations in that book or piece that you can begin to compose your bibliography. This then grows as you read more and add more to your central piece. 

**Note Taking**

Eco was writing from a different time. Much of the suggestions he makes on notes may now seem outdated. But however there is some relevance in a modern context. 

Firstly he talks about making notes more as part of an elaborate system of thinking. This system of thinking can be used just simply over the duration of the writing, or in this context the duration of the college students thesis. However he proposes a system of notes that, when considered in its totality is an extension of one’s reading and thoughts over a long period of time, or ones whole life. 

He first defines the ‘perfect’ system. When writing on some topic and having some *fixed table of contents* you can begin to connect the ideas in your contents with where you found them in the book. Which would be simply

1. Write the connecting idea in the margin of the book
2. Write the book and chapter in some index connected to the idea. 

However the issues he describes are to do with cases where you do not have the books, or a fixed table of contents etc. How then do you contruct a system of notes? Eco goes in to some detail about index cards, of different kind and different color. With connections to other cards and books etc. You then have this elaborate and almost magnificent system of notes that will aid you through your life. 

The question remains as to how to best structure a system of notes in order to fit the modern world. This comes with some assumptions about the nature of doing research. 

1. Massive quantities of books have become digitised
2. Books are likely cheaper. Or at the very least we are much wealthier. 
3. The ways that we can take notes are digitised
4. Capabilities of term search has expanded

The questions remains as to how best to organise notes. There was probably some wisdom in Eco’s system. A man who read so much would probably know what he was talking about. 

**Composing a bibliography**

Quick access to a llist of books would seem to be an easy thing to do. But however there is almost too much information to sift through. The ease of production and thus publication and the growing emand for books has made finding books slightly more difficult but not impossible. Eco suggests consulting a university library for their bibliographies on certain topics. The issues here are 1) you may not be in a university and 2) even if you are, the bibliographies may be limited, non existant for some topics and dated. 

Eco designates reading some general book about a topic and building your bibliography from that. And until there is some intelligent and quick way to compose a bibliography using the wealth of data available to us then this is often a good enough method. If you have a univeristy library, then you may have access to such topic bibliographies. 

For example, for an essay or thesis ‘Geophysical methods for exploration of Titanium’ You could start with searching your university bibliography for terms related to the title. Eg. 

1. Geophysics
2. Mineral exploration
3. Titanium(or in this context ‘Brookite’, ‘anatase’ etc)

On a first search I recieve a research starter with a bibliography which contains certain references.

- Gadallah, Mamdouh R., and Ray L. Fisher. *Exploration Geophysics*. Berlin: Springer, 2008. Print.
- Kirsch, Reinhard. *Groundwater Geophysics: A Tool for Hydrogeology*. 2d ed. Berlin: Springer, 2010. Print.
- Lowrie, William. *Fundamentals of Geophysics*. 2d ed. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2011. Print.
- Milsom, John, and Asger Eriksen. *Field Geophysics*. 4th ed. Chichester: Wiley, 2013. Print.
- Reynolds, John M. *An Introduction to Applied and Environmental Geophysics*. 2d ed. Chichester: Wiley, 2011. Print.
- Svetov, B. S. “Self-Consistent Problems of Geophysics: A Review.” *Izvestiya Physics of the Solid Earth* 51.6 (2015): 910+. Print.

From here we might have to look at further information on each book to gather whether the item is relevant. I can begin to start adding these books to a bibliography. Apps such as notion can then easily allow us to start categorizing this bibliography however we like. We may begin with ‘geophysics’ and add our books here. Here I believe is where we can start to leverage some of the beautiful aspects of technology, especiaally Notion. 

How you organise the bibliographies is then up to you. You could start with ‘geophysics’ but later find that the amount of material is too much to understand and gain context from. Notion can allow you to create subsections within pages. You are also free to connect certain pages to other pages. As you begin to grow a bibliography you can create a rich tapestry of books on many different topics.
