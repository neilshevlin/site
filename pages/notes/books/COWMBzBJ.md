# Crime and Punishment - Fyodor Dostoevsky
This was one of the earliest books that I had ever tried to read (I was 18 when I first read a book by my own choice). This could have also been my first audio book. I remember certain parts of the book with decent detail. Some ideas of plotline, and knowing some details of the character Raskolnikov. For whatever reason, the charachter Marmeladov is imprinted in my brain more than anything else from the book, primarily because the word [Marmeladov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment#Characters:~:text=Semyon%20Zakharovich-,Marmeladov) is slightly similar to the spanish word [Mamado](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mamado) which has various meanings across the spanish speaking world. The word Mamado can mean drunk in some countries and 'jacked'/'muscular' in spanish speaking countries. It was a funny similarity that I've used on occasion to show prowess in a book and a language that I really don't know well.
