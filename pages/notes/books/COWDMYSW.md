# The remains of the day - Kazuo Ishiguro
I can't quite put into words why I enjoyed this book so much. I have only read it once and yet it was the first book in a long time that completely captured my attention. Ishiguro's writing was extremely pleasing. Classics often tend to be translations, and the experience of reading them is often a bit frustrating. Remains of the day was the first book that I had read that was really written for the english speaker. There's a point in the book where the landscape of the english countryside is referenced as being beautiful in it;s own way for it's lack of drama. It's my intention to re-read and review this book in detail. My thinking tends to revolve around this idea of the landscape of england. It's broadly reflective of a few interesting quirks of british and to a lesser extent irish culture. The book left me with a sense of sadness, primarily from this emphasis on the lack of drama in life. I'll have to gather my thoughts on this book more in the future from a few re-reads.
