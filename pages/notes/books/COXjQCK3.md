## Some notes
- It's difficult to make any unique commentary on this book because it's so widely read. 
- There are probably some nuggets that arent really being picked up on tho. 
- It's a dystopian of all seasons relly. I guess the best way to look at is through looking at all the tyranies that Blair would have been against. Organised religion, the soviets, war mungerers etc. 
- The prohibition on sex was always the most interesting to me. Stripped of most of the joy, it's mainly about utility or maybe control. Sex is something we enjoy but it's not in our control that we like it. We just do. So removing the pleasure from sex, having it only be about reproduction is trying again to force control over our nature. 
- Could be read as understanding of human nature, and the ways it is often subjugated.
- Short so probably worth a re-read. I suspect most people are not reading it or reading it only once. Good value in a deeper look + looking at some of the other stuff Orwell/Blair wrote.
