# Pensees - Blaise Pascal
Pensees is a collection of Blaise Pascal's thoughts on human nature and theology. Pascal was a mathematician and physicist yet dedicated a great deal of his life to theological study. The text was published after Pascal's death when his writings were organized and grouped into sections. This version of the text includes a total of 923 fragments broken into 14 sections. Pascal was a prominent mathematician and scientist who devoted a large part of his life to the study of religion. In Pensées he explores human nature, religion, and humanity's relationship with God. 

Pascal explores the differences in the minds of people and what they should be wary of. He finds that it is best for a human being to have universality rather than be knowledgeable in one area. He describes how people should reflect upon themselves. They are born full of fault and sin. He stresses the importance of contemplation of God and their relationship with him. That they will find true happiness only through God. To Pascal, all people should either worship God or seek Him. 

Pascal explores the "wager" that humanity faces in their belief in God or their ignorance. If a person chooses to believe in God and is right, they will be rewarded with redemption. There is no loss if they are wrong. They face damnation if they do not seek God and are wrong. Pascal says it's foolosh to not worship or seek God, but that it should be contrasted with the lack of substantial proof for God's existence.

Pascal presents the relationship between justice and might and explains that these two features of society must exist alongside one another for a country to function properly. Pascal discusses a person in the context of their country rather than their relationship with religion. Pascal asserts both evil and goodness exist within each person. He also criticizes the work of other philosophers and accuses them of vanity. Pascal focuses on the idea that all people want to be happy and that all of their actions have this motive. However, he argues that people are such wretched creatures that God is the only one that can bring happiness. Pascal notes that even skeptics must be believers to a certain extent. He claims skeptics recognize their existence on this Earth and so prove that Earth has been created in some way. Pascal revisits the idea that all people should seek God despite the lack of proof and obscurities in religious writings. He questions why any person would choose not to seek God. Pascal focuses on the existence of believers and nonbelievers. He discusses religions other than Christianity. Pascal recognizes the Jewish religion as serving as the foundation for Christianity. He argues that the writings of Christianity have been preserved throughout time and make it the oldest religion. Pascal seeks proof of the beliefs of the Jewish and Christian peoples through the Bible. Pascal discusses symbols within Christianity. He claims that these symbols foreshadow events in the religion. Pascal focuses on the prophecies and proofs of Christianity. He believes that through the prophecies people are able to find strong proof of Jesus Christ (c. 6 BC–c. AD 30) and thereby God and the religion as a whole. Pascal reflects on the way in which he finds more truth and proofs of Christianity the more intensely he examines the religion. He rejects other religions. Pascal finds Jesus Christ to be convincing proof of the religion. Pascal explores the miracles of Christianity and proclaims them to be the foundation of the religion. He states that the miracles performed by Jesus Christ are no longer needed today because true Christians should worship based on tradition and the knowledge that these miracles occurred.
