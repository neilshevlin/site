# Carrying the Fire - Michael Collins
'Now’s the time, to prove through man’s action dignity may rise divinely high.' This book has special meaning to me. Collins lived a life that was incredibly normal. His description of his life in the periods prior to the moon landing are precious. For a man who went to the moon, there isnt much hubris in his writing. My take was that he was set back in life, through his creative interests and artistic pursuits. He seemed to have been the odd one out on the moon mission. But being less calculated and smooth, he stood out more. He strikes you as most deserving of his place, even though he was perhaps least merited. Glad to have read this before Collins eventually died.
