# Space Settlements: A Design Study - Richard D Johnson & Charles Holbrow
This is a document developed just a few years after the initial moon landings. It proposes some general ways that we could go about the colonisation of space. The workings are highly influenced by Gerard K. O’Neill. 

The book covers the follwing topics. 

1. Overall view of the colonisation of space. 
2. Physical properties of space. (What are the general conditions of space)
3. The Human needs in space
4. The Choices for colonisation
5. A tour of the proposed colony
6. How to build the colony
7. A view to the future of space colonisation

## Chapter 4 - Mining, transport and processing in space**

Posits that for reasons of economic transport back and forth from Mars and other areas is too expensive due to delta V costs referenced previous chapters. 

L5 and the Lunar surface are put forth as places where industrialisation may begin. 

The document supposed  a few downsides to processing of lunar materials on the lunar surface. Suggesting that the costs are rarely justified. Instead it should be done in orbit somewhere. 

Alluminium and Titanium are put forward as the primary metals that could be of use. They choose Alluminium for a few reasons. Due to its workability and its strength. But they do recognizze that serious study and research should be given to titanium as it would bring about massive cost savings for construction as it is light and stronger than alluminium. 

> It is chosen as the principal structural material only because information concerning titanium processing is somewhat less definite and,  in particular, the magnetic separation technique for linear ilmenite has not yet been demonstrated (Chp 4 pg 56)
> 

The highlighted materials in the report are as follows

- Silica
- Oxygen
- Alluminum Lunar anorthosite
- Titanium(Ilmenite) FeTiO_3 Iron and oxygen as biproducts

> The site for the base IS In the Cayley area at 4° 15° E. where Apollo 16 landed. This site was selected because of richness of lunar ore, suitably flat terrain for the launcher, and the near-side equatorial region gives a suitable trajectory to L2. Apollo samples had an aluminum content between 4.5 and 14.4 percent, the highest percentage being from this site. The Apollo missions did not provide any evidence of rich ore veins below the lunar surface (Chp 5 pg 106-107)
> 

> *Processing of Lunar Surface Material.* The aluminum and titanium extraction and refining processes suggested by this study are novel and largely unstudied because of the unusual nature of the lunar ores compared to terrestrial ores. The need to develop these processes in the laboratory, the terrestrial pilot plant and eventually the space pilot plant is critical to the success of the program. Efficient production of glass from lunar rock is also required under the limitation of minimal additives. Physical and optical properties of the resulting glass also need to be determined.(Chp 8 pgs 179-180)

The Article ends with a list of recomendations to do the following. 

1. Continue development of the space transportation system (shuttle) and of Spacelab.
2. Start development of the shuttle-derived Heavy- Lift Launch Vehicle.
3. Construct a large space laboratory for placement in low-Earth orbit in which experiments necessary to space colonization can be carried out.
4. Establish a lunar base to explore and to test for the availability of lunar resources.
5. Send an unmanned probe to the asteroids to deter- mine their chemical composition.

Bibliography

The book leans heavily on a few authors and some reports submitted to congress. Included are some of the relevent books and reports. However this may not be complete. 

- Extraction of Alumina by Leaching Melted and Quenched Anorthosite in Sulfuric Acid
- Method for Carbon Impregnation of Alumina
- Metal Production
