# Live Now, Buy Later
Throughout the course of your day you will make many decisions. When to wake up, what to wear, how to get to work. Yet many of these decisions that we make are not fully conscious decisions. Yet the payoff from the decisions is very real. You make an unconscious decision to pull your hand off a very hot surface. This is about as fast of a feedback loop that the human brain is capable of responding to. It is unconscious yet there is a snap judgement that the payoff of that decision is very very low.
 
Another example that might be more clear. You’re interested in purchasing a house. Now lets say, for simplicity that there are only two houses on the market available to you. There is house A and house B.
 
- House A costs $100,000, is 100 sq metres and is 1km from the city
- House B costs $300,000, is 300 sq metres and is 3km from the city
 
Making the decision of which house to buy is not a simple one. There is so much missing information. What does the house look like? What’s the neighbourhood like? Will I have neighbours?
 
At a blind guess like this you wouldn't really have a great insight as to which is the better house for you to live in.
 
Now say that you see both the houses and realise that you like house B for the space it provides you. There are rational reasons to choose a house with larger space. Maybe you have a large family, or 300 sq metres of carpet that you inherited from your grandmother. In some other cases, where all else was equal you choose the house with more size. You may have been conscious in your consideration of the house size. But there were probably many unconscious reasons for choosing the house because of size.
 
Now you get a mortgage, purchase the house, pay the taxes due, move in your carpets etc. After moving in you settle into the house and realise there is a long commute along a busy road when you’re driving to work. You are past the point of it making sense to sell the house, and buy a house closer to the city.
 
For some decisions, their consequences are widely distributed. With some time we get a better understanding of the consequences of our decisions. But we never can fully know. You might buy a piece of land, and for 100 years it is essentially worthless. Then one day you wake up and a man from an oil company is knocking on your door asking to buy your land. In the context of a house, you get the full experience through living there over time. You know the neighbour is playing drums on the weekend, and the neighbours are always arguing.
 
 
 
 
The absence of feedback can lead to more unconscious decisions. When you don’t get feedback for a purchasing decision until later, you are more likely to make poor decisions. When you’re buying a house, you might be better off with a cheaper house closer to the city, than purchasing a house with a lot of space but with a lengthy commute. If the decision is reversible, the impacts of these poor decisions are softened. The easier it is to make such decisions, the better it is for your whole decision making process.
 
 You did not get any feedback immediately in making the decision to purchase the house. Would you have been better off in purchasing the cheaper, smaller but more proximate house? Again you don’t know. In any case you’re stuck. After making a decision, the ability to reverse becomes more difficult.
 
But there is something we can do to limit our exposure to poor decisions. We increase the rate of received feedback. It’s important here to not only increase the feedback rate for some but many consequences of our decisions. This short exposure may be more painful at first. In fact we take much more risk more often. However the risks should be limited in duration and importantly reversible.
 
**Applications to the housing market**
 
The proposal here is a purchasing system where you live and rent in the house for some limited period of time, before being allowed to purchase the house. You can move in, you can experience the house, and get an actual sense of what it means for you to make these decisions.
 
This system could be summarised as a ‘live now, buy later’ system.
 
The buyer gets a much better understanding of the house. They get real feedback from the experience of living there. They live in the house and get to know its nuances. They know that the ceiling is actually a bit too low for them, or that the neighbours cigar smoke blows in their window in the evening. They live for a month in the house. Not completely free of unconscious bias, but now better informed.
 
The seller of the house does not explicitly gain much from this. However implicitly they do. The buy later, live now system is universal. So when they want to sell a house, they must make sure that the house is liveable. There are fewer chances for obfuscation. They can’t put up a good show. Dressing the house to seem much nicer than it really is. So they must pay more careful attention to the house. They address the issues that they know, after living in the house, annoyed them and others. They fix the crooked doors, ask the neighbour to stop smoking, and pay closer attention to the surrounding neighbourhood.
 
The effect applies to the seller too. When someone goes to sell their house, they get some money and when they go on to buy a new house the effect of living now and buying later applies. A system that requires you to live now, and buy later benefits the buyer of the house. But what it is also doing is encouraging people to treat houses as a home. The seller is encouraged to buy another home with the money. Otherwise they don’t gain from a system which focuses on feedback from a buyer first. To know the house well is to live in it. And you can’t live in a portfolio of investments.
