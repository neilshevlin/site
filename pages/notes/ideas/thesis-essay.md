# Thesis and Essay Writing

## Appeal to precision and depth
In [Eco's book on thesis writing](/notes/books/COUlEuCc) you get this strong feeling that what you've written in the past was probably trash. This is especially the case if you come from a technical background. There are less imposed rules of the scope of learning needed to make contributions. For example, in deep learning some major contributions have [come from undergraduates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). I liken this to the apparent reduction in teh amount of young startup founders. When the internet was new and barely understood, youth, risk taking and a willingness to look like an idiot was rewarded. There were no conventions for this new world, so anything worked. The more experiences, disciplined minds might have moved in to the industry. They follow the execution based playbooks. They can outperform the yungins. This tangent is meaning to serve the point that rules and imposition ('playbooks') of these rules works best when the field is not new. 

You get the sense that you can't possibly have missed an author in a bibliography. You cant possibly think of doing something so large and non specific for a thesis. To be fair, there is an empiricist side of this that is fair. The ideas of the anti library are good in my opinion. They keep you in check. But it also censors. You are much less likley to write anythin at all for fear that you havent read enough or though deeply enough for example. 

Now contrast that with Paul Feyerabend's Against Method. He essentially makes the point that the imposition of these 'rules' in science (Methodology of science) is what prevents scientific progress. Right okay, we see this is the problem that seems to be peer review for example (Not going digging for references, fairly sure they're there tho). So what do? On one hand I get almost offended when I see people what is the equivalnet of dog shit in writing. Low effort thinking which had like maybe a couple of drafts if any and wasnt really making any effort to read in to the matter more than a book or two. I also get mad at myself because I don't put the effort in to doinfg deep work for long periods of time. I will get bored quickly(probably). 

In my mind I have this appeal to precision and depth. This isn't new to me. It's probably why I was more oriented to Catholocism. It's probably why I left when I felt I saw more rigourous thinking else where (eg analytical philsophy). But this appeal to precision hampers writing too. We want to be right. We don't want to say something dumb. I always had the fear of saying dumb shit growing up. Being dump was humiliating in our family (They werent all that smart, but being dumb was always discouraged). I like the security of not saying anything. The status it gives me for holding my tongue for some amount of time. Maybe it's the right strategy in the long run. It's the warren buffett, Nassim Taleb, don't fucking dare do something stupid or you'll fucking die. But the stakes are low. Really low. All you have to lose is your life. And your life is cheap. It's other peoples lives that are expensive.

## Feynman was a bit of a midwit
I like Paul Feyerabend. He reminds me of the people I grew up with. Contrast his ideas about the methods of science with his opinions on the new generations of science. He in essence though that Feynman was super smart but lacked any sophistication at all. It's not critique of method, but of style. Let's say that Feynman was smarter than Einstein. Great, but Einstein had more style/Class A E S T H E T I C S. He had metaphysics in his palm. You get the impression that because Feyerabend had Popper as his mentor that the ideas of the metaphysics was not contrary to science. That it could and probably was the inspriration for many great achievements in science. Feynman generated his creativity from the natural observations. He like the idea of psychedelics but was too chicken to try them. He misunderstood Jesuits and they misunderstood him. The idea behind alot of this is that the place we derive a lot of inspiration from is non scientific often. The greater the exposure, the more interesting the insights into the world. (ps. I actually really like Feynman)

## ~$ echo Eco 
So to come back on the point. The enforcemnt of precision can be a useful thing. But I think it's better to see these methods in the Christian sense and not in the Islamic sense. Christianity gives you this world view, a way to act, love your neighbour, don't kick pidgeons etc. Islam tells you. Something in the same sense as love your neighbour. But not in the same manner. Perhaps in Islam, God is Arbitrary. In Christianity he is rational. You can can bargain with him. To understand writing (or science) in this way is to say that you might be best to read alot more books, to keep the antilibrary, to be rigourous and thorough. But if you feel that you want to do your own thing, by all means just don't go hurting anyone(simplification??ðŸ‘€). For sure you drop a lot of clarity in writing, which is probably indicative of being without clarity of thought. So maybe work with it. We know what's rigourous and we know what isn't. Why not lean on that? 

## Note taking systems and the barbell approach
I aproach note taking in this barbell strategy mainly. For sure read lots. Read more than lots. But don't let a lack of reading in a subject get in the way of taking notes. Read the book, get some understanding. Intepret, misinterpret, falsify and support. Ideally if you have some creativity it can really shine. But what about the middle ground? If what is risky and what is rigourous are known you can use the the editorial process for the middle ground. Look at you thoughts before and now with some rigour in mind. But don't let it be limiting force of your writing. You can expand and strengthen your creativity, in all it's avenues through the rigourous process.
