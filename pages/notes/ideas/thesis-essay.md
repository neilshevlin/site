# Thesis and Essay Writing

## Appeal to precision and depth
In [Eco's book on thesis writing](/notes/books/COUlEuCc) you get this strong feeling that what you've written in the past was probably trash. This is especially the case if you come from a technical background. There are less imposed rules of the scope of learning needed to make contributions. For example, in deep learning some major contributions have [come from undergraduates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). I liken this to the apparent reduction in the amount of young startup founders. When the internet was new and barely understood, youth, risk taking and a willingness to look like an idiot was rewarded. There were no conventions for this new world, so anything worked. The more experienced, disciplined minds might have moved into the industry. They follow the execution based playbooks. They can outperform the yunginz. This tangent is meant to serve the point that rules and imposition ('playbooks') of these rules works best when the field is not new.
 
You get the sense that you can't possibly have missed an author in a bibliography. You can't possibly think of doing something so large and non-specific for a thesis. To be fair, there is an empiricist side of this that is fair. The ideas of the anti library are good in my opinion. They keep you in check. But it also censors. You are much less likely to write anything at all for fear that you haven't read enough or though deeply enough for example.
 
Now contrast that with Paul Feyerabend's Against Method. He essentially makes the point that the imposition of these 'rules' in science (Methodology of science) is what prevents scientific progress. Right okay, we see this is the problem that seems to be peer reviewed for example (Not going digging for references, fairly sure they're there tho). So what do? On one hand I get almost offended when I see people do the equivalent of dog shit in writing. Low effort thinking which had maybe a couple of drafts if any and wasn't really making any effort to read into the matter more than a book or two. I also get mad at myself because I don't put the effort into doing deep work for long periods of time. I will get bored quickly(probably).
 
In my mind I have this appeal to precision and depth. This isn't new to me. It's probably why I was more oriented to Catholicism. It's probably why I left when I felt I saw more rigorous thinking elsewhere (e.g. analytical philosophy). But this appeal to precision hampers writing too. We want to be right. We don't want to say something dumb. I always had the fear of saying dumb shit growing up. Being dump was humiliating in our family (They werent all that smart, but being dumb was always discouraged). I like the security of not saying anything. The status it gives me for holding my tongue for some amount of time. Maybe it's the right strategy in the long run. It's the warren buffett, Nassim Taleb, don't fucking dare do something stupid or you'll fucking die. But the stakes are low. Really low. All you have to lose is your life. And your life is cheap. It's other people's lives that are expensive.
 
## Feynman was a bit of a midwit
I like Paul Feyerabend. He reminds me of the people I grew up with. Contrast his ideas about the methods of science with his opinions on the new generations of science. He in essence thought that Feynman was super smart but lacked any sophistication at all. It's not a critique of method, but of style. Let's say that Feynman was smarter than Einstein. Great, but Einstein had more style/Class A E S T H E T I C S. He had metaphysics in his palm. You get the impression that because Feyerabend had Popper as his mentor that the ideas of metaphysics were not contrary to science. That it could and probably was the inspiration for many great achievements in science. Feynman generated his creativity from natural observations. He liked the idea of psychedelics but was too chicken to try them. He misunderstood Jesuits and they misunderstood him. The idea behind a lot of this is that the place we derive a lot of inspiration from is often non scientific. The greater the exposure, the more interesting the insights into the world. (ps. I actually really like Feynman)
 
## ~$ echo Eco
So to come back to the point. The enforcement of precision can be a useful thing. But I think it's better to see these methods in the Christian sense and not in the Islamic sense. Christianity gives you this world view, a way to act, love your neighbour, don't kick pigeons etc. Islam tells you. Something in the same sense as love for your neighbour. But not in the same manner. Perhaps in Islam, God is Arbitrary. In Christianity he is rational. You can bargain with him. To understand writing (or science) in this way is to say that you might be best to read a lot more books, to keep the antilibrary, to be rigorous and thorough. But if you feel that you want to do your own thing, by all means just don't go hurting anyone(simplification??ðŸ‘€). For sure you drop a lot of clarity in writing, which is probably indicative of being without clarity of thought. So maybe work with it. We know what's rigourous and we know what isn't. Why not lean on that?
 
## Note taking systems and the barbell approach
I approach note taking in this barbell strategy mainly. For sure, read lots. Read more than lots. But don't let a lack of reading in a subject get in the way of taking notes. Read the book, get some understanding. Interpret, misinterpret, falsify and support. Ideally if you have some creativity it can really shine. But what about the middle ground? If what is risky and what is rigorous are known you can use the editorial process for the middle ground. Look at your thoughts before and now with some rigour in mind. But don't let it be the limiting force of your writing. You can expand and strengthen your creativity, in all its avenues through the rigorous process.
