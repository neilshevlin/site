Sir Joseph Banks - Scientist explorer - recommends Botany Bay - Sydney

A good amount of the population are convicts. → The risk for normal individuals seems to high. The convicts have very little to lose, much to gain, a chance at buying their freedom?

Ships only bring enough food for the non convict settlers. → Nor do they have enough skilled farmers.

James Martin writes his "Memorandoms" Which documents the experience. 

Second fleet - brought more convicts and  made the situation worse. 

Sir Richard Bourke 1831-1837 - passes the magistrates act - limits the punishments to convicts and allows freed convicts the right to own property and serve on juries

Bourke is credited with others like William Wentworth with the ending Australia's position as a penal colony. 

The convict was usually issued with a ticket of leave for good behaviour and after 7 years or so they would be given a certificate of freedom. 

Free settlers started to go to Australia in larger and larger numbers and around the time of cessation of convicts, free settlers objected more and more to the transportation of prisoners. 

Arthur Philip raised the flag with some other other marines.

Many of the people who journey out to New South Wales are the wrong types of people to be starting a colony and many are also unfit. 

Feelings of isolation kicked in when there were irregular ships coming in to port. This lessened as trade began to pickup in the area.

> "From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word "Botany Bay" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction" - Captain David Collins
