# Fasting
- Sodium
    - 30-35 mg per kg of body weight
    - If excercising consume 1g of salt prior to excercising
    - Deficiency - headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, cramps
- Magnesium
    - 500 - 600mg per day
    - Tends to get worse with duration of a fast
    - Magnesium Oxide is a laxative - Other forms might suit better
    - Deficiency can cause muscle seizuresm, cramps, fatigue etc
- Water
    - Consume about 2.5 to 3 litres daily
    - More if excercising
- Zinc
    - Dont consume without food - Can cause nausea
- Potassium
- Calcium

## Phases of fasting
- Anabolic 0-4 hours
    - Food is broken down in to glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids
    - [Leptin](https://www.notion.so/Leptin-67699287b8ba44b78a64e7cb1ed677a3) increases
    - [Ghrelin](https://www.notion.so/Ghrelin-f1cd0a75aa7241998d193f2e25221cfe) decreases
    - Pancreas secreates insulin
    - [Insulin](https://www.notion.so/Insulin-6f81beef664946dfac8fd4a94a2a4973) shuttles nutrients to cells
- Catabolic 4-16 hours
    - blood glucose continues to drop
    - Release of insulin is low
    - glucagon starts to rise
    - glucagon triggers liver glycogen to rise
    - suppresion of mTOR opens the door to autophagy
- Fat burning 16-24 hours
    - glucose from gluconeogenisis begins to rise
    - Lipolysis breaks down fat stores
    - Fatty acids are mobilized for energy
    - Liver begins to synthesize ketones
    - AMPK activity promotes autophagy
- Ketosis 24-72 hours
    - Liver glycogen stops being a source of glucose
    - Gluconeogenesis reaches its peak and drops off
    - Blood ketones begin to increase - Beta hydroxybutyrate BHB 0.5 - 2 mM
    - Total ghrelin output decreases
    - Diminished growth signals and increased AMPK promotes autophagy
    
- Deep ketosis
    - Liver continues to produce ketones which become the primary fuel for the brain
    - IGF-1 levels are low, as is glucose and circulating insulin
    - BHB production  increases
    - Lower than baseline ghrelin
    - autophagy accelerates
