# Evangelisation in Opus Dei
## Personal context
One of the biggest points of criticism for Opus Dei is how they find and recruit new members. As it turns out I happened to have a different experience with Opus Dei that even members would have been used to. Because I was newly involved with a bunch of Catholic things around where I live, I got invited to 'student recollection'. Student recollections are short retreats for students. There's usually some prayer, a meditation guided by the priest, some benediction and then beers and food. I can't remember how or when, but someone gave me a copy of 'the way' by the founder Jose Maria Escriva. I more or less dropped most contact with Opus Dei after that. Still friends with one of the guys who was in Opus Dei, but I didn't really have any interest in it. The Way was interesting because it essentially spoke a much more informal and modern tone than all of the other holy books I'd read. At the time I was considering being a monk, friar, priest or getting married. The Catholic community outside of Opus Dei still has a problem of clericalism in my opinion. Some of it is built up by this need for people to have some visible sign of their sacrifice. For some time I wanted to be able to wear the cool priest fit and be trad etc. All a bit cringe in retrospect.
 
For some time I read the book ‘the way’ and read more about Opus Dei online. To be honest, a lot of the negativity and hate that it was getting was more appealing than anything else. Most people I know, who hear about the idea of corporal mortification or celibacy are near appalled. I had an idea in my head that things had to be hard. That you needed to suffer in order to get to Heaven etc. Yet at the same time, I wanted to work in the real world. Still had latent interest in startups, technology and space. Some portion of clerical Catholicism did a good job of telling you that interests of the world are fruitless and I bought the line fully. I applied to join the Dominican Friars after some consideration. However, they denied me from entering that year because it was too late. I got over things quickly, and it clearly was a fad. My interest in Opus Dei was still there. I think what I did was I went up to my friend, who was celibate member and announced that I wanted to join. He was basically lost for words because to him that sort of thing doesn't happen. He explained that it was more involved than that. You usually had to be spending time around Opus Dei, going to spiritual direction etc. I wasn't doing any of that. So going to these events that are usually seen as their 'recruiting mechanisms' was the way I would join.
 
I won't go into more detail around all of my experiences. Eventually I was offered to stay in a University residence, but I had barely any way of paying for it. However, eventually I worked something out without them in terms of cost and I moved in. It was maybe around 2/3 months after I moved in that I 'whistled'. Something that members will usually remember and celebrate the anniversary of.
 
## Context of the organisation
Opus Dei had grown massively in the 20th century. Its membership was nearly 100,000 by the time I joined. I whistled as a numerary in the organisation. The numbers of members aren't officially published, but the estimate that about 20% of the ~100k members are celibate members is probably about right. I don't even know the numbers in my country. But to put it into context, I was the third numerary to whistle in a close time period. The guys before me joined around 1 to 3 years before me. Before them, there was about a 15 year gap before an Irish numerary whistled. There was probably another 10 year gap before that, but that's just an estimate. The point being that Opus Dei in Ireland had a large number of members that joined 25-50 years ago and then very very few members since. This isn't the case everywhere. There are some regions around the world where membership is growing. However for most of the west, there are similar patterns.
 
## Growing pains
Opus Dei grew so fast in the early days. They started with just small groups of Men and then it ballooned to a massive and influential organisation with men, women and priests. Understanding an organisation like this is tricky. Opus Dei had growing pains in the beginning. Jose Maria Escriva had to spend time reminding members of the core spirituality of the organisation. This would get misinterpreted, misunderstood or maybe even just ignored at times. I've come to think of it not as a symptom of Opus Dei, but of organisations that grow quickly. At first, the founding members really got the culture. They see its development in the right context. They know how to think and act according to their spirituality.
 
The spirit in Opus Dei to bring new members into the spirituality is not specific to Opus Dei. It's essentially a core Christian idea to spread the gospel. The members obviously have such high commitment to the organisation and they want to share that with others. So the wish to spread these ideas to share is not troubling to me. I've found that this is less universally accepted though. There's a view that there should be essentially no evangelisation. That it's always exploitative or forcing. I've found these arguments to be lacking for a whole bunch of reasons.
 
What seemed to be the case was that there were members who joined after the original foundation who were perhaps not as effective at demonstrating the organisation's merits. There was perhaps a lack of charisma. Now this came in a time where Opus Dei was being slandered in Public, and later when the book and film the Da Vinci code further dragged it through the mud. In fact, nearly all of the Catholic organisations in this time were seeing declines. They all seemed to share a similar problem. New found liberties in the west meant that Catholic organisations were now competing for the intellects of the young people. Young people perhaps found the members of the time to be unable to meet the demands of a modern curious mind. In short, people's levels of curiosity about the world can change much quicker than organisations can adapt. Newfound interest in Catholicism Is mainly an issue of reencountering. More interesting ideas bubbled to the surface again and people were free to engage with them.
 
I think this was probably the case for Opus Dei too. If Jose Maria Escriva was working in tech, he would be described as a visionary. He had a temper that he tried a lot of his life to keep in control, and he had a force to him. In so many ways he was a rebel. He started and built an organisation that was way ahead of its time. He was told on several occasions by clerics that he was a couple of centuries too early. All of this serves to make a point that he was a curious, driven and charismatic leader. You get the sense that if he didn't decide to devote his life to God and Opus Dei, that he would have done something just as great. The founding members were the same. Álvaro del Portillo was a well educated Engineer, and you see much of this across the organisation. They sacrificed much in the time of the Civil War. They went to other sides of the planet to start Opus Dei. Fundamentally they took risks.
 
So my judgement was that at some point this stopped happening. The people joining were a bit too boring. Their parents were in Opus Dei. They went to an Opus Dei school. They got a job in big tech or as a lawyer etc. To perhaps clarify the point I'm making here, I'll use some of the big five personality traits for the founding and middle stage members.
 
The Founding members might have been:
- High in openness to experience (Willing to try this brand new thing)
- High in conscientiousness (Willing to work hard and sacrifice for this new thing)
- Average in extraversion (There were perhaps more extraverted members, but I don't think extraversion was pure reason these people attracted new members)
- Low in agreeableness (Jose Maria was a fiery man, same for a lot of the older men I met)
- Low in neuroticism (They practised their duties in the middle of wars and shipped themselves off to the middles of nowhere)
 
In Contrast, the middle stage members might have been:
- Low in openness to experience (Much more conventional jobs, lifestyles and interests)
- High in conscientiousness (Maybe even more so than the founding members, however perhaps less seriously driven)
- Average in extraversion
- Average/Low in agreeableness (If you joined because your parents were in Opus Dei, you might be more agreeable. What were you rebelling against? Perhaps they wanted you to be a supernumerary but they probably weren't going to disown you.)
- Average in neuroticism (There were still members being sent to the middle of nowhere, but it was less common and peace was a bit more common)
