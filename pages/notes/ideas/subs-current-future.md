# Future and current submersible technology
### From the National marine facilities in the UK
- the [NMF](https://www.noc.ac.uk/files/documents/about/ispo/COMMS1155 NMF TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP 202021 V4.pdf) in the UK is supporting
    - GO-SHIP
    - Argo
    - RAPID
    - OSNAP
    - Ellet
NMF has two main reserach vessels - RRS James Cook and RRS Discovery Their capabilities include
    - Hydroacoustic surveys
    - Clean seawater sampling
    - integrated data logging
    - CTD surveys( conductivity, temp and Depth)
    - Deep water coring, towing and trawling
    - Seismic surveys
    - Adaptable laboratory space
    - ROV operations
- Rechargeable AUV's is an area that the NMF is intersted in. This is so that they can increase the length of the missions that they go.
- NMF have had trouble locating where the AUV's are after surfacing.
### AutoSub 6000 problems
- unreliable internal control system
- large amount of monitoring time
- lack of desired obstacle avoidance andsituational awareness
- undesired level of autonomy
- low navigational accuracy
- bad under ice capability
- water sampling ability
- Autosub6000 was based of a mid 90's control system.
- Missions are now becoming multi vehicle, and so a level of coorperation between the vehicles is neccesary
- The hover ability around canyon walls is an important function for theNMF
- Initial trials of the new AUV are expected in 2021, expect this to be delayed for both governmental project and COvid-19
- some of the long range sub's can hibernate, and hang around at the sea bed for a long time.
