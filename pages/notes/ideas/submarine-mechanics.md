# Submarine Mechanics
## Some random technical details
### length to bow ratio
- optimal ratio is 7:1
- Pressure drag - from being wide
- Skin Friction - from being long
- ratio of 7 minimises the drag forces of both above features
### Neutral buoyancy 
dependent on: 
- salinity
- depth
- temperature
### Ideal Shapes
- Parabolic stern
- Eliptic bow
- These are altered slightly to make it cheaper and easier to manufacture.
### Submarine Sails
- The sail is the upper part of the vessel(Dorsel Fin)
- Helps prevent against rolling of the vessel
- Sail's can contribute up 30% of resistance.
- On real subs, it is used as a observation tower.
- Important in dynamic stability
- Has pressure drag, skin friction drag and interference drag.
- Sail should be as small as possible
- As slim as possible
- Sail Fairing should be as slim as possible also
### Submarine Propellers
- Different number of blades on the propulsion motor have different effects
- Takes a fan shape
- More blades → More propulsion effieiency
- Bernoullis law and Newtons thrid law
- Alluminium or stainless steel blades
- Blades are either forged or welded together
- Blade Numbers
    - Three
    - Four
    - Five
- Blade Pitch → Fixed pitch of controllable pitch
- Control pitch propeller will allow for greater manouverability
- Fixed pitch is easier to design and manufacture.
### Submarine Rudders
- Submarines will typically use a rudder to control direction.
- Types
    - Balanced rudder
    - Spade Rudder
    - Full Skeg Rudder
    - Semi Balanced Skeg Rudder
    - Semi Balanced Rudder, aft of skeg or deadwood
    - Unbalanced, aft of keel or deadwood
    - Transom bung, surface piercing
