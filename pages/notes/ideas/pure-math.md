# Bertrand Russells defintion of pure mathematics

## Russells Definition
{% quote %}Pure Mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form “p implies q”, where p and q are propositions containing one or more variables, the same in the two propositions, and neither p nor q contains any constants except logical constants. And logical constants are all notions definable in terms of the following: implication, the relation of a term to a class of which it is a member, the notion of such that, the notion of relation and such further notions as may be involved in the general notion of propositions of the above form. In addition to these, mathematics uses a notion which is not a constituent of the propositions which it considers, namely the notion of truth.{% /quote %}
 
## Classes and Sets
Set theory is the logic of classes. A class is a word that could be used in the same way as set. So set theory is a logic of sets and how sets relate to each other. These sets (or aggregations of sets) are either finite or infinite collections of items. A set is a set that is itself a member of some class. A proper class is one that is not a member of any other class.
 
Take the set of all lions on earth. This set also belongs to the set of all mammals on Earth. In distinction, consider the following: The set of mammals containing exactly one member. By definition if the set contains any more than one member, then it is not in the set of mammals containing exactly one member.
 
 
## Principles of mathematics not being entirely controversial
The definition of mathematics in the definition seems to be fully justified. The problem analyses the idea of mathematics that we have in our mind when we use the term mathematics, however unconsciously. This analysis is said to be philosophical. Moving from something that is complex to something that is simple. Most of the questions involved will be one's that are no different to ones that are philosophical. In this way, many of the questions which have found themselves in the domain of philosophical argument, now can be found to have certain answers. Things like infinities, the nature of numbers and time can now have some answer, because the questions are reduced down to pure logic.
 
 
## All pure maths follows formally from twenty premises
Mathematics seems to follow from deductions. However some of the older forms of logic, such as aristotelian syllogistic logic and symbolic logic were not able to capture the full range of mathematics. The thinking of Kant relied on this idea, which was that mathematical reasoning is not formal, but always used intuitions. This was Kant's a-priori knowledge of space and time. Progress in Symbolic logic has, especially from work by Peano showed that mathematics does have formal reasoning. There are 10 rules of deduction and 10 rules of implication which allow all of mathematics to be deduced. 
 
## The Assertion of formal implication
The idea is basically that from logical principles you can deduce logical principles. Leibniz advocated for such a system for example. Things like Euclidean axioms were found, but they don't just come from the logical principles, which Kant built upon. But since Non Euclidean Geometries have come along, what we now hold is that both the Euclidean and Non euclidean geometries are equally true. Whether or not they hold in some real world case is something for the task of applied mathematics and science. Nothing is affirmed in euclidean or non euclidean, except the implications themselves. The assertion that mathematics makes is that propositions can be asserted in relation to some set of entities. And some other propositions can also be asserted from those entities. But we cannot say that the propositions are true or false separate from the entities. We only assert a relation between the propositions. Which is called formal implication.
 
## Use of variables
{% latex %}Mathematical propositions have implications but they also have variables. Something like $1+1=2$ seems like it is not concerning variables or an implication. But it can be shown that it says "if $x$ is one, and $y$ is one, and $x$ differs from $y$, then $x$ and $y$ are two" Now it contains both propositions and variables. Something is a constant if it is dealing with some very specific number in some equation for example. One specific line, or one specific time t. Otherwise, even if we use something like $ax + by = c$, we are still using variables. The variables are the x and y. The constants are the $a$, $b$ and $c$. But the constants still can represent any variable until their instantiation in reality. So 1, 2, 3, dog, cat and Koko the gorilla are all constants. {% /latex %}
